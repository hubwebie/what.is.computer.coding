**When you're starting your coding journey, one of the most exciting – and at times overwhelming – things about it is just how much there is to learn.**

* You'll discover different languages, frameworks, libraries, inventions and conventions.

* One technology often requires knowledge of another one, and everything seems to be interconnected and intertwined.

* With new technologies coming out often in such a fast paced and ever-changing industry, it can quickly get confusing for beginner coders.

* When learning how to code, instead of just focusing on learning a specific technology, it can also help to learn the foundations – the building blocks – and to peel back the layers of abstraction to get to know the underlying principles that all these technologies have in common.

* Understanding what coding is at a fundamental level will make solving problems easier and will give you a better understanding of how these technologies work underneath the hood.

* In this article we will learn what coding is so you have a solid foundation on which to build.
